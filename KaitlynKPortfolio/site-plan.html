        Hello, my name is Kaitlyn-marie Kryzanski, Welcome to my personal website.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this website in order to not only showcase my skills thus far in Web Development,
        but to also create a platform wherein I would be able to more easily connect with those
        interested in both my services and background.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this website you will find a page with further information 'about me', including
        an outline of my resume, as well a page with all of my contact information.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Trumbull, Connecticut by a large, strong-willed, and self-made
        family based out of Stratford. I grew up loving the Long Island Sound, family, and the value of hard work.
        After graduating high school in 2020, I was able to enroll as a student at the University
        of Maryland where I was able to begin taking courses in the STEM field. Shortly thereafter,
        I found that I did not have much of an idea of where these courses would take me, or at the 
        very least, where I wanted them to take me. After some much needed time in the 'real world',
        I ultimately found a program offered by Brigham Young University that aligned with not only my 
        values, but also the path that I felt suited me. I was able to continue working my full-time job while
        also working towards a degree in Computer Science part-time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been able to meet a lot of great people along the way as I have traveled and worked
        through these past couple of years. Though I realize my path has not been the most 
        traditional, I feel that ultimately the time I have spent working and learning to understand my
        skillset, has been beyond valuable to my future. I feel that life is more fulfilling when we take
        the time to further our education in as many areas as possible. I look forward to seeing where my 
        degree in Computer Science will take me, and I am enthusiastic about opportunities in which I am able
        to combine my experience with that of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in finding opportunities wherein I can bring my experience in Computer Science together
        with my overall knowledge of Business Development and the psychology behind what makes a strong business 
        work. So far, I have enjoyed working with various teams and businesses where I was able to build upon my 
        perceptions of what makes a business work, and what is needed on the employees' side in terms of bringing 
        their best work to the table. As I have been able to connect with more people, I feel that I have been able 
        to grow in my awareness of how people are truly motivated towards progress, and in this understanding, I 
        have found that I am more personally more motivated to being able to create a successful business!
