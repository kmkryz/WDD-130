        <h2>Kaitlyn Kryzanski</h2>
        <p>I am seeking a degree in Applied Technology.
        I actually started this degree by attending BYU Pathways, and so far this is one my first classes as a true BYU Idaho student! I really enjoy coding and I am so excited to be able to be get my degree entirely online. 
        </p>
        <p>I love to travel and I have enjoyed all the freedoms that online schooling provides me with. I originally attended the University of Maryland, but had a little trouble my first semester (feeling lost, not having freedom, worrying about what to study, etc.) so I decided to take some time off to figure out what I wanted to do. Luckily, I soon got my patriarchial blessing and found the answers I was looking for. I am originally from Connecticut, but like I said, I enjoy moving around, so most recently I have been living in south Florida.</p>
        <p> I enjoy are going to the beach as well as going on roadtrips to new and strange places. I also love meeting new people and hearing about their lives, so hopefully I will better get to know some of you! </p>
